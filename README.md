# nunjucks-i18n-webpack-plugin

This project mixes nunjucks-webpack-plugin & simple-i18n-webpack-plugin implementation as a single plugin. 

## Why

Simple-i18n-webpack-plugin just works with HTML Webpack Plugin by taping into the compilation process through a hook. Using this implementation it becomes an all in one solution for Nunjucks templating + internalization.
